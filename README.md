SystemC-AMS
===========

The SystemC AMS PoC 2.3.4 library offers an implementation of the IEEE 1666.1 SystemC AMS standard.

The Proof of Concept implements all classes, functions and macros defined in the standard and thus provides the algorithm that is required to execute standard compliant models.


> :warning: **This is not an official SystemC-AMS repository**:

SystemC-AMS is maintained by COSEDA and can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.coseda-tech.com/systemc-ams-proof-of-concept).

Since it is released under Apache2.0 license and I couldn't find an official Git repository I decided to create a fork for patches and easier dependency fetching within projects.
