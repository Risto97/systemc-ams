SystemC-AMS NEWS -- history of user visible changes

SystemC-AMS version 2.3.4
    *SystemC 2.3.4 compatibility
    *Support of the newest compiler (clang 16, gcc12, Visual 2022)
    *Compatible with Accellera SystemC AMS regression tests (should run without any error)
    *Compiler must support C++11 (e.g. > gcc4.9)
    *TDF scheduler re-implemented
        -full static schedule (also for SystemC synchronization)
        -TDF cluster executed within method processes (before they were executed in thread processes)
        -Slight performance improvement ~10%
    *ELN reference nodes are not anymore ignored for eln clustering
        -can be disabled (old behavior) by configure option:  --disable-reference_node_clustering
    *Performance statistics added
        -can be disabled using the configure option:  --disable-performance_statistics
        -influence to performance seems to be below 5%
    *Experimental parallel tracing
        -can be enabled by configure option --enable-parallel_tracing
        -performance gain can be significant if tracing dominated the runtime
        -due the datatypes of the Accellera SystemC implementation can't be read thread safe
         in seldom cases the simulation crashes if SystemC datatypes are traced
        -if you use parallel tracing you should always close the trace file - otherwise may large portions are not written
    *SCA_DISABLE_PORT_ACCESS_CHECK - if this defined during model compilation the check whether the port methods are used in
     the allowed context are disabled (e.g. port write only in the processing callback), in dependency of the model, this can 
     lead to a considerable performance gain
    *Numerous smaller bug fixes
    *All Warnings and most of the clang sanitizer issues fixed - recommendation : compile always with -Wall
    

SystemC-AMS version 2.3
    *SystemC 2.3.3 compatibility

    *Feature preview for standard update
        -generalized AC
        -piece wise linear (PWL) for eln and lsf
        -physical units
        -solver parameter
            -algorithm : euler/default
            -reinitialization_steps : <number> (default: 1)
        -interactive debug feature 
        -implementation of dump/print methods
